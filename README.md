`pendulum_2stage_lobatto`: Solve the plane pendulum using 2-stage Lobatto IIIA-IIIB.  Uses trivial starting approximations.

`pendulum_2stage_lobatto_SA`: Uses good starting approximations to solve the plane pendulum over 2 steps using 2-stage Lobatto IIIA-IIIB, and plots the errors of the starting approximations vs. stepsize.

`pendulum_3stage_lobatto`: Solve the plane pendulum using 3-stage Lobatto IIIA-IIIB.  Uses trivial starting approximations.

`pendulum_2stage_lobatto_SA`: Uses good starting approximations to solve the plane pendulum over 2 steps using 3-stage Lobatto IIIA-IIIB, and plots the errors of the starting approximations vs. stepsize.
